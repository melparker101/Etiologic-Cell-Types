# Etiologic-Cell-Types

## CELLECT 
CELLEX and CELLECT were used to obtain prioritised etiological cell-types for adipose tissue and a variety of phenotypes. This was also expanded to in-house ovary data.
Data used:
- human and mouse atlas paper single nuclei seq data;
- atlas paper single cell seq data;
- in-house adipose SN-seq data;
- in-House ovary SN-seq data.

- WHRadjBMI;
- T2DadjBMI;
- HT;
